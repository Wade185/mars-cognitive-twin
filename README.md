# Mars Cognitive Twin ðŸ§ ðŸš€

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered digital twin for Mars habitability**.  
It simulates how humans, plants, and resources can survive on Mars by combining:
- Cognitive modeling (human decision-making & stress handling)
- AI optimization (resource allocation & survival strategies)
- Environmental simulation (Mars atmosphere, radiation, soil)
- Data analysis (growth, sustainability, energy use)

## Folder Structure
- `cognitive_model/` â†’ Human behavior & decision-making models
- `environment/` â†’ Mars conditions (atmosphere, soil, radiation, etc.)
- `ai/` â†’ Machine learning & optimization algorithms
- `simulation/` â†’ Core simulation engine
- `data/` â†’ Datasets for Mars (NASA datasets, simulated data, experiments)

## Goal
To create a **digital life-support system** that helps scientists plan how to make life sustainable on Mars.

## Future Vision
- Integrate real NASA Mars data (soil, radiation, temperature)
- Run large-scale simulations of colonies
- Provide open-source AI tools for Mars mission planning
