#  Space Habitat – Beyond Earth Survival   

---

##  Overview  
**Space Habitat – Beyond Earth Survival** is a project exploring how humans, plants, and technology can survive on celestial bodies beyond Earth.  
It focuses on building **AI-driven digital habitats** that simulate survival in extreme environments like moons, asteroids, and planets.  

---

##  Main Mission  
-  Develop **AI-assisted life support systems** for long-term survival.  
-  Design **food, water, and waste recycling systems** for closed-loop habitats.  
-  Optimize **energy generation and thermal control** under harsh conditions.  
-  Ensure **communication, stowage, and medical care** in space colonies.  
-  Create **virtual habitat assistants** for 76+ celestial bodies (Aegaeon → Phobos).  

---

##  Vision  
- To provide a **digital survival framework** for scientists, students, and explorers.  
- To **simulate and plan future colonies** across moons, asteroids, and planets.  
- To act as a **blueprint for sustainable life beyond Earth**, where every resource is managed by intelligent systems.

##  Why It Matters  
Survival beyond Earth is humanity’s next frontier.  
This project is designed to merge **science and imagination** to prepare for future missions where humans may live, thrive, and build civilizations across the solar system.
